      <p>johnj allday website v0.01</p>
<p>The main goal:<br />
-[ ] explore wasm<br />
-[x] frontend/design explorations<br />
-[ ] AI-MCP-server for SSG</p>
<p>This ended up being a Static Site Generator for now.<br />
I wanted to build a website and make it more integrated to my computer.<br />
Hopefully you'll see the progress of this website grow down the line.</p>
<p>If you want the full source code for this static website generator,<br />
I'll post and share the updates via this website, and you'll see how this gets integrated.</p>
