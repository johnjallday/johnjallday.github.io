      <p>I think it's inevitable that AI is going to be essential in almost every aspect of life. Maybe it's already too late. But, here's how I'm using AI to meet my need.</p>
<ol>
<li>I make tools for myself: I've dabbled with python, C, Rust, Go, and js and Lua script. At the end of the day, I spend 90% of my work on my laptop. Making music is fun, but there are parts that I don't enjoy. (It's all about the micro gainz) I'm looking for ways to reduce my workload, so I can spend more time on things I enjoy.</li>
<li>I use it to help with my demo. I don't always have access to female singers. When I'm in a hurry, I try to sing female topline myself and convert it with AI.</li>
<li>I use it as educational tool. To make sure, I understand things properly. I do second check with AI.</li>
</ol>
<p>here's my take on AI for now.<br />
At the end of the day, it helps you do things that you can already do a lot faster. Your actual value comes from how much you can do when things go wrong.</p>
<p>For example, let's look at a fully automated kitchen. robots cook and wait the table. The reason you'd get paid is either to fix the robot, or actually cook and wait the table when the robots malfunctions.</p>
