<p>The main goal:<br />
-[ ] explore wasm<br />
-[x] frontend/design explorations<br />
-[ ] AI-MCP-server for SSG</p>
<p>This ended up being a Static Site Generator for now.<br />
I wanted to build a website and make it more integrated to my computer.<br />
Hopefully you'll see the progress of this website grow down the line.</p>
<p>What is a Static Site Generator?</p>
<p>A Static Site Generator (SSG) is a tool that converts source content — typically written in Markdown or a similar format — into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Unlike dynamic websites that rely on server-side processing for each request, an SSG pre-builds pages during a build step, allowing them to be served quickly and securely.</p>
<p>Some key advantages of using an SSG include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Pre-built files load faster since there's no server-side processing for each page request.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> With no dynamic content generation at runtime, the attack surface is significantly reduced.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Write content in Markdown; let the generator handle templating and building.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Static assets are easy to cache and can handle large amounts of traffic without heavy backend infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Fewer moving parts relative to traditional CMS or dynamic server architectures, simplifying updates and deployments.</li>
</ul>
